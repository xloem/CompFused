Gentoo users
------------
You need to emerge the following ebuilds :

emerge lzo
emerge sys-fs/fuse


Compile
-------
tar -zxf cf-200?????.tgz
cd CompFUSEd/v0.04/
make

This should create a cf_main file. Some file in the archive are symlinks to this file.

Configuration
-------------

You can run several instances of compFUSEd. Each will use a different daemon. The configuration file for each daemon has 
the same name as the executable but with the .conf extension. Below you'll find an example (the cf_main.conf).

IMPORTANT: - the configuration file must either be in same directory as the binary or, if not found, in the user home!

Multiple mounts
---------------

You can have several compFUSEd mounts on your system. Although you could just copy the binary and give it a new name,
I it is a better idea to make a symbolic link. Not that it saves your lot of space, it will make upgrading easier.
2 examples are included in the archive: cf_portage and cf_kde


Mount example
-------------

This how to put the Linux kernel source code on a compFUSEd mount. The idea is to save some space on the /usr/src directory.
Assuming that like any user you have like 3 or 4 subdirs you end up with a fat /usr/src directory. On the other hand you do
not recompile your kernel that often so this is good candidate for compression.

We do it step by step. The necessary files are already in the archive: cf_linux and cf_linux.conf. We will store the compressed 
files in the /usr/.src_cf hidden directory (see backend line in the configuration file).

1) cd /usr
2) mv src src_backup
3) mkdir .src_cf
4) mkdir src
5) 'cd back to the directory with the compFUSEd file'
6) mount the new and empty fs: ./cf_linux /usr/src
7) cd /usr
8) cp -r src_backup/* src
9) ls src

You should have seen all the directories and files in step 9. That's it, this are compressed. If you trust compFUSEd enough
you can now throw the src_backup directory, put your .config file(s) somewhere safe tough :-P
